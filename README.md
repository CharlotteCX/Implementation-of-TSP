Implementation of Traveling Salesman Problem using Greedy and Genetic Algorithms                 

- Implemented greedy heuristic and genetic algorithm to solve Traveling Salesman problem using C
- Investigated the effects of genetic algorithm parameters, selected the appropriate ones that approached to the optimal solution and tested the effectiveness of the algorithm
- Compared the run-time and the performance of the two algorithms on standard data library TSPLIB
